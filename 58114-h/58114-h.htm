Todd</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Perks</span> <i>the
maid servant are engaged packing the travelling case on
chair</i>, <span class="GutSmall">R.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; There, there, that
will do.&nbsp; My pink satin dress there; my handkerchiefs; my
collars&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Perks</span>. (<i>snatching a pair of
Wellington boots from the floor</i>)&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s
master&rsquo;s new boots, mum, can&rsquo;t you make a tiny bit of
room for them between your lace cap and your Indian shawl?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; Perks, I&rsquo;m
astonished at your suggesting such an association:&mdash;put them
in the carpet bag.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Perks</span>.&nbsp; La, mum, there&rsquo;s
not room for a tooth-pick in the carpet bag; how we&rsquo;re ever
to get it&rsquo;s jaws closed again I don&rsquo;t know; and
there&rsquo;s a dressing case, and a box of cigars, and a fishing
rod, and two umbrellas, a telescope and a pair of slippers, to be
put up yet!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my
ugly?&nbsp; What can have happened it?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page4"></a><span

<i>enters</i>, <span class="GutSmall">L.</span> 1 <span
class="GutSmall">E.</span>, <i>with a Bradshaw&rsquo;s Guide in

<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Here it is!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve found it!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T. (<span
class="GutSmall">R.</span>)&nbsp; My ugly?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<span
class="GutSmall">L.</span>)&nbsp; No, my dear, our route.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been studying Bradshaw all the morning, and I find
that if we leave&mdash;page 49&mdash;I mean, if we leave the
Paddington&mdash;no&mdash;the Euston-square Station&mdash;at 7
o&rsquo;clock, a.m., we can get by the Oxford Junction
to&mdash;to&mdash;page&mdash;(<i>turning over the leaves</i>)
page&mdash;page&mdash;no&mdash;that&rsquo;s the Tilbury and
Southend Line.&nbsp; Ah! here it is!&mdash;we&rsquo;re then to
take the express train to&mdash;to York&mdash;where we meet the
Midland Counties, you perceive, and then see&mdash;page
74&mdash;(<i>turning over the leaves</i>)
74&mdash;74&mdash;74&mdash;74&mdash;where there&rsquo;s a branch
to the Eastern Counties that takes us to Norwich&mdash;and when
we get to Norwich there&rsquo;s a junction that takes
us&mdash;somewhere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t precisely know
where&mdash;but I have a strong reliance on Bradshaw.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; I wish you would put
down Bradshaw, Todd, and exert the limited powers with which
heaven has blessed you, and help me to pack and cord these
things&mdash;you leave everything for me to do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; My dear Laura,
there&rsquo;s the difference between us&mdash;you&rsquo;re
remarkable for physical energy&mdash;I for contemplative
repose.&nbsp; The study of Bradshaw fatigues one&rsquo;s mind so.
(<span class="smcap">Perks</span>, <i>who has been clearing off
luggage</i>, <span class="GutSmall">R.</span>, <i>gets round at
back to</i> <span class="GutSmall">L.</span> <i>and takes up
concertina from chair</i>)&nbsp; Mind that concertina,
Perks&mdash;it&rsquo;s the only instrument I play&mdash;(<i>takes
it from her</i>, <span class="GutSmall">C.</span>), and having
devoted myself for six months to &ldquo;My Mary Ann,&rdquo; I
rather flatter myself I shall create an extraordinary sensation
amongst the foreign echoes this summer. (<i>he commences
playing</i> &ldquo;<i>My Mary Ann</i>,&rdquo; <i>when a knock is
heard</i>)&nbsp; Hah! who can this be?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Perks</span>
<i>crosses at back and exits</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">R.</span> 1 <span class="GutSmall">E.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; I dare say my uncle
Croker&mdash;come to bid us good bye.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Your uncle, my dear, is
a very worthy man.&nbsp; I should feel bound to respect his
venerable hairs, if he had any left to respect, but that
hydropathic habit he has&mdash;of throwing cold water upon
everything&mdash;is very disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T. (<i>kissing</i> <span

class="GutSmall">C.</span>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<span
class="GutSmall">L.</span> <i>shaking his hand</i>)&nbsp; How
d&rsquo;ye do, Croker?&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; Never saw you
look so jolly in your life. (<i>aside</i>)&nbsp; Dismal as a
cherub on a tombstone!&nbsp; It was very kind of you to call; we
start on our tour in the morning, so you&rsquo;re just in time to
see the last of us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>. (<span class="GutSmall">
C.</span>)&nbsp; The last of you!&nbsp; Ah, Samuel, I hope there
may be nothing prophetic in your words, but I have a melancholy
foreboding&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T. (<span
class="GutSmall">R.</span>)&nbsp; For goodness sake, uncle,
don&rsquo;t talk of melancholy forebodings&mdash;when we are
looking forward to the Continent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Aye, what do you think
of six months amidst the classic scenes of Italy.&nbsp; Fancy
smoking a cigar on the summit of Vesuvius; think of dancing the
Tarantula amidst the ruins of Pompeii; imagine the delicious
maccaroni&mdash;and the lazzaroni&mdash;and all the other
oni&rsquo;s. (<i>forgetting himself</i>)&nbsp; Picture to
yourself the indescribable rapture of floating on the moonlit sea
with a lovely creature beside you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T. (<i>indignantly</i>)&nbsp;
Mr. Todd!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<i>recollecting himself
crosses</i> <span class="GutSmall">C.</span> to <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Todd</span>)&nbsp; Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!&nbsp;
Of course my dear, I was thinking of you&mdash;idealizing you as
it were&mdash;in a poetic dream. (<i>crosses back to</i> <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span>)&nbsp; By the bye, Croker, is there
anything we can do for you abroad?&nbsp; We expect to be in
Boulogne to-morrow night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>. (<span class="GutSmall">
C.</span>)&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t wish to alarm you&mdash;but
I had once a dear friend who was lost in crossing to
Boulogne.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<span
class="GutSmall">L.</span>)&nbsp; Lost! hem! dear me!&nbsp; But
with a good steamer you&rsquo;re tolerably safe, I believe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of
several appalling catastrophes to steamers.&nbsp; Now, if
you&rsquo;d like to hear a few of them. (<i>sits on</i> <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span> <i>of table</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">C.</span>)</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span><span
class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T. (<i>seated</i> <span
class="GutSmall">R.</span> <i>of table</i>)&nbsp; Oh, dear,
no!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself, uncle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; The trouble is nothing;
it is to me always a melancholy pleasure to prepare my friends
for the worst.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<i>seated in arm chair</i>,
<span class="GutSmall">L.</span>)&nbsp; We&rsquo;re very much
obliged to you&mdash;but we&rsquo;d rather have it without
preparation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; Do you know, uncle,
we purpose crossing the Alps into Italy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; It was but yesterday I
was reading of a party of six young Englishmen being buried
beneath an avalanche on the great St. Bernard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Buried&mdash;alive?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; Alive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; B&mdash;b&mdash;but it
don&rsquo;t often happen, does it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; Continually, at this
season.&nbsp; Ask Albert Smith; <i>he</i> knows:&mdash;and what
is most distressing, they all leave large families&mdash;of
creditors to deplore their loss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not naturally
timid; but these things are sufficient to shake the stoutest
heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; Take my advice, Samuel,
and stay in your own country.&nbsp; If you must travel&mdash;if
you must go to the seaside&mdash;have you not Gravesend,
Southend, and Mile-end?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Oh, but you know, if
one never moves from one&rsquo;s native shore, one might as well
be born a muscle&mdash;or a barnacle!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; Besides, my dear
uncle, it&rsquo;s now too late to alter our arrangements.&nbsp;
What would they say at Brompton if we went to Margate, with a
passport for Naples?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; Have you considered the
practices of the Italian innkeepers, who skin an Englishman
alive, when they catch him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t mind
that; I&rsquo;ve undergone the operation so frequently in our own
happy country.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s the
danger of the roads.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to alarm you; but I
had a dear friend once, who was travelling with his young wife,
as you might be, to Naples&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; To Naples?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; To Naples&mdash;where
they were stopped in a lonely mountain road by brigands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Did you
say&mdash;by&mdash;brigands?</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span><span
class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; Twenty of them&mdash;all armed
to the teeth.&nbsp; Their captain, a ferociously handsome-looking
scoundrel, clapped a carbine to my unfortunate friend&rsquo;s
head&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<i>earnestly</i>)&nbsp; Blew
out his brains?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; All that heaven had
granted to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Atrocious wretch!&nbsp;
And your unfortunate friend&rsquo;s wife&mdash;did they shoot her
too?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>. (<i>solemnly</i>)&nbsp;
No&mdash;no;&mdash;it&rsquo;s a horrible tale!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<i>rises</i>)&nbsp; Then
I&rsquo;d rather not hear it. (<i>crosses to</i> <span
class="GutSmall">C.</span>)&nbsp; Laura, my dear; on reflection,
hadn&rsquo;t we better confine our views to Margate, this
year?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T. (<i>rises</i>)&nbsp; No,
Todd&mdash;no.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made up my mind, and packed my
trunks for the Continent; and nothing on earth shall alter my
determination.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Of course not, my
dear&mdash;I&rsquo;m fully aware of the steadiness of your
purpose; but might it not be prudent&mdash;a&mdash;that
is&mdash;a&mdash;advisable, to pause.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; You know, Todd, I
never pause.&nbsp; To-morrow morning, at six, we start!&nbsp; The
policeman has promised to ring our bell at five.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Then it&rsquo;s
fixed.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Mrs. Todd</span> <i>goes up</i>
<span class="GutSmall">R.</span> <i>and crosses at back to</i>
<span class="GutSmall">L.</span>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>. (<i>rises</i>)&nbsp; Ah!
well,&mdash;if you will rush on your fate!&mdash;I must be going.
(<span class="GutSmall">C.</span>)&nbsp; Good bye, Laura.
(<i>embraces</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Todd</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T. (<span
class="GutSmall">L.</span>)&nbsp; Good bye, dear uncle&mdash;good
bye!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crok</span>.&nbsp; Bless you both!&nbsp;
Hah! I wish you a pleasant journey, with all my heart.&nbsp; Keep
up your spirits, Samuel, man is born to misfortune. (<i>crosses
to</i> <span class="GutSmall">L.</span>, <i>then turns to</i>
<span class="smcap">Todd</span>)&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ve
settled your worldly affairs.&nbsp; Good bye&mdash;this may be
the last time we shall ever meet each other in this
world&mdash;but remember,&mdash;I tried to cheer you to the

anticipation of our journey that I did this morning.&nbsp; Vague
apprehensions <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Croker&rsquo;s suggestion about arranging my worldly affairs
should not be neglected. (<i>sits</i> at <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span> <i>of table and takes papers out of
writing-desk</i>)&nbsp; I have some papers and documents here
which I must put in order before I depart for &ldquo;that
undiscovered bourne from whence no traveller gets a return
ticket.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pshaw!&nbsp; I must not let the dismal
forebodings of old Croker prey upon me!&nbsp; Now! think of it,
I&rsquo;ll light one of those Turkish cigarettes, which my
friend, Captain Crasher, brought home from the East.&nbsp; He
tells me they&rsquo;re prepared with opium and produce the most
tranquillizing effect on the spirits. (<i>he takes a cigar case
from the table drawer and lights a cigarette</i>)&nbsp; This I
hope will restore the serenity of my mind.&nbsp; Be a man, Todd!
be a man!&nbsp; Croker&rsquo;s an ass!&nbsp; He and his stories
may go to the devil. (<i>smoking and arranging his
papers</i>)&nbsp; Humph! ha! pooh! capital weed! (<i>taking up a
bundle of papers</i>)&nbsp; What are these?&nbsp; &ldquo;Accounts
settled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Um! um! (<i>puts them down and takes up
another parcel</i>, <i>turning them over</i>)&nbsp; Mrs.
Todd&rsquo;s letters to me when we were courting.&nbsp; Ah!
delicious smoke!&nbsp; A lock of her silken hair!
(<i>smoking</i>)&nbsp; How beautifully it curls! and this brown
sprig of myrtle, which she wore the night we vowed to love for
ever.&nbsp; Ha! we were green then!&nbsp; Her eyes remind me
of&mdash;(<i>reading endorsement on another document</i>)&nbsp;
&ldquo;The last will and testament of Samuel Todd.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dear me! what a sudden chill the sight of this solemn instrument
brings over me.&nbsp; The paper looks so ghastly white, and the
ink so deadly black; that, gazing at it as I sit here, seems like
staring in the face of my own ghost.&nbsp; Pshaw!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not give way to these desponding fancies!
(<i>smoking</i>)&nbsp; By the bye, I may as well add a codicil to
my will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for some time;
no one can tell what may happen.&nbsp; Let me
see&mdash;(<i>running over the will</i>) &ldquo;I give and
bequeath <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>all

(<i>writes</i>) &ldquo;Provided always, that if my said wife
shall survive me, and shall intermarry with a second husband, I
hereby revoke all and every of the bequests hereinbefore
contained.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s only justice!&nbsp; If it
was my misfortune to be left a gay widower&mdash;would I marry
again? never!&nbsp; At least, not until I had reflected
seriously&mdash;and&mdash;pooh!&nbsp; Deliciously soothing this
cigarette!&mdash;not until, I had weighed in my
mind,&mdash;the&mdash;delightful aroma, and the&mdash;object
however lovely, with&mdash;the memory of the dear

mystery; carrying about with him a broken heart, and a concertina
to match. (<i>plays a few false chords on his concertina</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; A stranger?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; A weeping stranger from
a foreign land!</p>
<p class="poetry">Samuel Todd, it is my name;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Britain is my nation,<br />
Brompton is my dwelling place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Naples my destination.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my passport in elegiac verse!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>. (<i>curtseys</i>)&nbsp; Your
humble servant, Signor Toddini.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<i>aside</i>)&nbsp; Signor
Toddini!&nbsp; I like Toddini&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll stick to
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; Travelling in search of
health, Signor?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; No, in search of
pleasure; my wife&rsquo;s dead&mdash;my adored Laura (<i>plays a
few lively notes</i>) who was suddenly snatched from these
widowed arms three months since, in the bay of Genoa.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>. (<span
class="GutSmall">R.</span>)&nbsp; Ah! drowned?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<span
class="GutSmall">L.</span>)&nbsp; Drowned&mdash;drowned&mdash;no
more.&nbsp; Neptune, envious of my happiness robbed me of my
earthly treasure&mdash;still, I don&rsquo;t complain of
Neptune&mdash;no, I forgive him from my heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; But what accident has
directed you to this secluded mansion, signor?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; The strangest one in
the world; you must know I rode out from Naples this morning to
visit a celebrated ruin in this neighbourhood;&mdash;I&rsquo;m
fond of ruins, when they&rsquo;re in a perfect state!&nbsp; I was
mounted on my guide, while a mule carried my umbrella&mdash;no,
I&rsquo;m wrong, I was mounted on my umbrella, while the guide
carried the <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>mule&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m wrong again&mdash;for
&rsquo;twas the mule carried <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Well, I was riding
along enjoying myself wonderfully, thinking of my lost Laura,
when, bang came a bullet through my hat! (<i>takes off his hat
and puts his finger through a hole in the side</i>)&nbsp; There!
(<i>goes up and lays his hat on chair</i> <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span> <i>of table</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>. (<i>laughing</i>,
<i>aside</i>)&nbsp; My uncle&rsquo;s usual way of requesting
travellers to stop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; In the agitation of the
moment I unconsciously drew a pistol from my belt&mdash;it went
off spontaneously&mdash;I heard an awful groan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; A groan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; A groan that made me
tumble from my mule and roll down a tremendous precipice by the
roadside:&mdash;a torrent roared at the bottom, in which I should
have inevitably finished my tour, if my concertina had not
luckily got entangled in the roots of an old tree, where I hung
nearly strangled till evening, when I managed to extricate myself
and crawl through the wood, until I found a path, which led me to
this hospitable abode.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; Then you have no idea
where you are?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Not the remotest; but I
can always make myself at home wherever I go.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t live quite alone in this tumble-down old place?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; No, I have an uncle,
who resides here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Oh! (<i>half
aside</i>)&nbsp; A joint proprietor with the rats and owls.&nbsp;
And what is this uncle of yours, my dear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; Hem! he has something
to do with taxes on the road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; I know:&mdash;a
collector of Highway Rates.&nbsp; One of the family used to call
regularly upon me at Cozy Cottage, Brompton.&nbsp; The fellow
used to bring the Gas and the Sewers with him, and when the
Sewers came, I was certain the Thames Water Company was not far
off.&nbsp; Your name, sweet flower?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; Marietta.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; Marietta!&nbsp; Do you
know, Marietta, you bear a striking resemblance to my lost
Laura&mdash;you have her eyes exactly, only yours are
darker&mdash;the same nose, only yours differs in shape&mdash;the
same mouth, only yours is smaller.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span><span
class="smcap">Mari</span>. (<i>laughing</i>, <i>aside</i>)&nbsp;
A ridiculous creature! but I must try and get him out of the
trap, into which he has unconsciously walked.&nbsp; Signor, you
must not remain here.&nbsp; If my uncle returns and finds you, it
may be worse for you, and where to put you for the night I
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; I have it:&mdash;you shall
sleep in the fowl house&mdash;there (<i>points through window at
back</i>) on the opposite side of the garden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>.&nbsp; The fowl house!&nbsp;
You could never think of putting me to bed amongst the cocks and
hens, consider my feelings.&nbsp; Bless me! what a look of my
lost Laura! (<i>aside</i>)&nbsp; I feel I&rsquo;m on the brink of
an adventure!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mari</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some
fresh pea straw in the corner, on which you can lie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Todd</span>. (<i>aside</i>)&nbsp; This

<p>St. Nicholas, send us some luck!&nbsp; For the last three
weeks there hasn&rsquo;t been a traveller between Itri and Naples
worth stopping, till this morning, when I had a crack at a fellow
mounted on a mule, who looked as if his <a

well lined; but he must have been the devil, for he disappeared
like a stone in a lake, after lodging a bullet in

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s a
strange story.&nbsp; Mr. Todd and myself, wishing for a little
continental air, set out on a foreign tour last spring, and got
as far as Genoa, where we saw the mole;&mdash;but it&rsquo;s no
more like a mole than I am:&mdash;and nothing would serve Todd
but we should have a sail on the bay, though he knew the sea
always upset me&mdash;and it <i>did</i> upset me&mdash;it upset
us all&mdash;for our boat was overturned by a squall, and I
should inevitably have died an amphibious death, if I had not
clung instinctively to life;&mdash;and a vigorous sailor, who
swam&mdash;and swam&mdash;and swam, until we were fortunately
picked up by the boat of a steamer, bound to Marseilles, where I
was safely landed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jaco</span>.&nbsp; And your
husband?&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; I learned that he too
had been saved; but imagining I had met a watery end, he went
into mourning for my loss, and to divert his melancholy, had
continued his tour.&nbsp; I immediately set off for Italy, and
succeeded in tracing him to Naples, where I was going
when&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jaco</span>.&nbsp; That fortunate accident
happened to your carriage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. T.&nbsp; Fortunate?</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
